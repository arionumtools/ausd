    <div class="w3-panel w3-border-left w3-border-white w3-hover-border-green">

    <p><strong>1.What is the difference between AUSD and other USD stablecoin? </strong></p>

<p>We issue a corresponding amount of AUSD based on other stablecoin,just like originally issued US dollars based on gold reserve.</p>
<p>1 AUSD is always equal to 1 USD Stablecoin.</p>
<p>Holding AUSD can avoid the risk of a single stablecoin, we take this risk. </p>

  </div>
  
  
    <div class="w3-panel w3-border-left w3-border-white w3-hover-border-green">

    <p><strong>2.Why should I trust AUSD?</strong></p>
    
<p>Reserve stablecoin balance is public,everyone can verify in real time.
</p>
<p>We will open source the exchange process program on github.</p>

    <p><strong>3.What is Worn Wallet, is my money still safe?</strong></p>
    
<p>The money is safe,this is for privacy consideration.</p>
<p>Wallet older than 3 months and used more than 100 times will be marked as worn.
</p>
<p>Although the address is anonymous, but all transactions are an open book in internet.</p>
<p>You can continue to use it, but just like a real wallet, you need to replace it.</p>
  </div>
  
      <div class="w3-panel w3-border-left w3-border-white w3-hover-border-green">

    <p><strong>4.With multiple addresses, can I use the HD wallet?</strong></p>
    
 <p>We do not use HD wallets,this only provides a false sense of privacy and security.</p>
 <p>The person who gets your seed can take all your money and can view the transactions of all addresses generated by that seed.</p>
 <p>No one will guarantee that the seed will not be leaked in the future for any reason.</p>

        <div class="w3-panel w3-border-left w3-border-white w3-hover-border-green">

    <p><strong>5. I need to back up every wallet, right?</strong></p>
    
 <p>This is something you have to do, is your money, you need to do this.</p>
  <p>Set up different backup methods for different wallets. If one wallet leaks, the money in the other wallets is safe.</p>
 <p>You can delete a wallet after you save the private key.</p>
 <p>It’s like paper money, but it’s smaller and lighter,only you know it when you hide it.</p>
<p> Delete worn wallet so that no one can know you own that wallet. over time, all transactions in that wallet are irrelevant to you.</p>
  </div>
  
          <div class="w3-panel w3-border-left w3-border-white w3-hover-border-green">

    <p><strong>6. Is Fast payment safe? Why doesn't Bitcoin treat Mempool transactions as paid?</strong></p>
 
  <p>The payment is safe, because the transaction fee is fixed, so the payer cannot pay a higher fee to invalidate the unconfirmed transaction.</p>
<p>For large transaction, please wait for more confirmations to prevent 51% attack.</p>
  </div>
  
            <div class="w3-panel w3-border-left w3-border-white w3-hover-border-green">
            
      <p><strong>7. Why do I need to wait a minute before I can make a payment?</strong></p>
 
  <p>This is because the wallet does not have enough AUSDC, and the exchange AUSDC require 1 block confirmation.</p>
  
  <p>We have the corresponding AUSD exchange address, keep some AUSDC for payment, can avoid this situation.</p>
